## Overview

This repository contains the code, aggregated data outputs and documents for **Pilot Study 1**, part of a doctoral dissertation in Sociology at the **Universidad Complutense de Madrid (UCM)**, on workforce recertification and upskilling/reskilling strategies.

The study analyses the distribution of firm-level training activity, its association with wages and labour productivity, and the fiscal implications of eliminating the SENCE Training Tax Credit (Franquicia Tributaria SENCE), using microdata from the **Seventh Longitudinal Enterprise Survey (ELE-7, 2020-2022)**.

**Key findings:**
- Only 8.3% of formal firms declare any collaborative training activity (16.3% large firms vs. 4.8% SMEs vs. 3.9% micro).
- The training-wage premium in SMEs is ~15% (OLS, controlled for sector, age and group membership), rising from 11.3% in 2017 to 15.0% in 2022.
- The concentration ratio (large/SME) increased from 2.9x (2017) to 3.6x (2022): the Matthew Effect in human capital.
- Fiscal break-even analysis shows the elimination of the FT is fiscally regressive if more than 44% of the observed wage differential is causally attributable to training — within the 40-70% range estimated by the international literature.

|--------|-------------|--------|
| ELE-7 (Ministerio de Economia, 2024) | 7th Longitudinal Enterprise Survey, 2020-2022 | Public: economia.gob.cl |
| ELE-4 to ELE-6 (INE/Ministerio de Economia) | Earlier waves for harmonised series | Public: ine.gob.cl |

> **Important:** Raw ELE microdata files are NOT included in this repository due to confidentiality restrictions. The `data/raw/` folder contains only variable dictionaries and descriptors. To replicate the analysis, download the official ELE-7 CSV modules from economia.gob.cl and place them in `data/raw/`.

## Methods

- **Training proxy (CAP_ALLY):** Binary indicator derived from the inter-firm collaboration motives block (ELE-7 variable D097/equivalent). Captures declared collaborative training activity — a conservative lower bound, not a direct measure of SENCE FT usage.
- **OLS models:** Log wage bill per worker and log sales per worker, controlling for sector (CIIU 2-digit), firm age, group membership and size category.
- **Harmonised series (ELE-4 to ELE-7):** Best-available proxy for training in each wave, documented in `scripts/fase3a`; results constitute a *harmonised series*, not a strict panel.
- **Fiscal sensitivity (break-even):** Parametric simulation of net fiscal balance as a function of alpha (causal fraction of wage differential), including payroll taxes, health contributions and pension contributions (~20% of wage mass).

---

## Limitations

- CAP_ALLY is a proxy, not a direct measure of SENCE FT usage. The ELE-7 contains no variable identifying FT users.
- OLS models are associative, not causal. Causal identification requires an administrative linkage (SENCE registry x ELE via RUT) under an institutional agreement not yet publicly available.
- The harmonised series uses non-identical variables across waves; all differences are documented in `scripts/fase3a`.
- Fiscal simulation uses conservative default parameters; results should be updated with official DIPRES and SII figures.
